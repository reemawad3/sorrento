      <h2> sorrento</h2>
      <p>Sorrento by the Sea is a luxury apartments business located and operated on the picturesque  Mornington Peninsula, an approximate one-hour scenic drive from Melbourne. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Sorrento is lucky to boast having some of the oldest and highest limestone buildings in Australia, 
        and be one of the few townships to have the rugged  front ocean beach at Port Philip Bay
        and the wilder surfing beaches on the Bass Strait side,
        coastal walks, swimming with dolphins and fishing. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Sorrento is approximately 90 minutes drive from Melbourne. 
        New freeways and tollways are making Sorrento much more easily accessible by car.
        From Melbourne CBD take the Monash Freeway onto Citylink or Eastern Freeway 
        (from Eastern &amp; Northern suburbs) onto Eastlink/Peninsula Link then Mornington Peninsula 
        Freeway to Rosebud. Point Nepean Rd will take you on a pleasant drive along 
        the bay all the way to Sorrento, or Melbourne Rd can also be used from Rye 
        if you want to avoid some traffic.</p>
